## Project Overview

This project compares virtual learning using **Duolingo** with structured **classroom learning** to determine which method better supports language acquisition for college students. Using surveys, a 30-day case study, and interviews with students from the University of Washington, we explored five key learning themes:

- Flexibility & Time Commitment  
- Engagement & Entertainment  
- Proficiency & Pronunciation  
- Cultural Comprehension  
- Practical Usage & Interaction

---

## Methods

- **Survey**: Distributed via r/languagelearning subreddit to understand learner preferences and perceptions.
- **Case Study**: One team member studied Korean on Duolingo for 30 consecutive days.
- **Interviews**: Conducted with 8 UW students enrolled in Chinese classes and familiar with Duolingo.
- **Python Notebooks**: Used for data visualization and analysis.

---

## Key Findings

- **Classroom learning** was preferred for structured feedback, motivation, and cultural immersion.
- **Duolingo** was praised for flexibility and entertainment, but criticized for oversimplification and lack of speaking practice.
- Our final recommendation provides a **preference-based decision framework** that guides learners based on six dimensions (e.g., Prestige, Flexibility, Time).
